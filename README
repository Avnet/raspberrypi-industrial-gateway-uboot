Summary:
========

This is the source code for u-boot.

We use the cross compiler cross-gcc-8.3.0-pi_2-3 tool chain. Any other suitable cross compiler for the ARM may be used.

To compile u-boot use the following.

make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf-

The image is u-boot.bin and should be copied to /boot/kernel7.img

Note:

We do not process cmdline.txt so if you need to change it then edit .config file entry BOOTCOMMAND=

If you have enabled secure boot feature with the raspberry pi then you must send the resulting image to Avnet so it can be properly signed.
